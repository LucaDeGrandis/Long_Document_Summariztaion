**Net Zero Commitment and Strategy**

DWS has committed to becoming climate neutral as part of the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative, aligning with the Paris Agreement to achieve this goal well ahead of 2050. As a significant step towards this commitment, DWS has set an interim target for 2030, aiming to reduce the Weighted Average Carbon Intensity (WACI) of 35.4% of its global Assets under Management (EUR 281.3 billion) by 50%. This ambitious target reflects DWS's dedication to integrating climate considerations into its investment processes and corporate operations. The strategy involves active engagement with investee companies to encourage alignment with science-based targets and the development of innovative products and services that support net zero ambitions. DWS's approach is guided by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) framework, ensuring a credible and robust foundation for its decarbonization efforts.

**Governance and Risk Management**

DWS has established a comprehensive governance structure to manage climate-related risks and opportunities, with the Group Sustainability Council (GSC) and the ESG Advisory Board playing pivotal roles. The Executive Board, supported by these entities, oversees the integration of climate considerations into DWS's overall sustainability governance. Climate risks are categorized into "outside-in" factors, such as physical and transition risks, and "inside-out" factors, including environmental impacts. These risks are embedded in DWS's Risk Management Framework, ensuring that sustainability risks are considered integral to the firm's strategy. The framework includes scenario analyses to assess the potential impact of climate change on DWS's business activities and investment strategies, providing insights into the relationship between risk and return under different climate action scenarios.

**Metrics and Targets**

DWS measures its progress towards climate-related goals using a set of Sustainability Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) aligned with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. These KPIs include Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with a focus on reducing operational emissions and enhancing portfolio alignment with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI). In 2021, DWS improved its CDP rating to a B, reflecting its commitment to enhancing climate-related disclosures. The firm continues to track its progress against these metrics, ensuring that it remains on track to achieve its net zero ambitions.

**Engagement and Proxy Voting**

DWS actively engages with investee companies to drive real-world change and support the transition to a net zero economy. In 2021, DWS engaged with over 500 companies, voting in favor of 94% of climate-focused resolutions in the Americas and 92% in Europe. The firm's enhanced Engagement Framework sets targets towards sustainability outcomes mapped to the Principal Adverse Impact (PAI) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This framework emphasizes the importance of active ownership and proxy voting as tools to influence corporate behavior and promote transparency and accountability in climate-related matters.

**Scenario Analysis and Climate Risk Assessment**

DWS employs scenario analyses to understand the potential impact of climate change on its business activities and investment strategies. These analyses consider different climate action scenarios, assessing risks and opportunities under varying degrees of global policy coordination and ambition. The corporate scenario analysis quantifies strategic risks and opportunities related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters, while the portfolio scenario analysis evaluates the potential impact on expected returns and risks of investments. By integrating climate scenarios into its Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions (LTCMA) Framework, DWS aims to provide a comprehensive view of the long-term financial implications of climate change, ensuring that its investment decisions are informed by robust climate risk assessments.
