**Credit Rating Trends and Actions**

In July 2025, the credit rating landscape saw significant developments across various sectors. The Republic of Austria received a negative trend assignment on its credit rating, while Hungary was assigned a new credit rating. Despite uncertainties surrounding global tariffs, financial institutions experienced more positive credit rating actions than negative ones, with notable upgrades in global banks such as UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG, and Morgan Stanley. These institutions benefited from stronger trading results and more predictable revenue streams. European banks are expected to continue experiencing positive credit rating migration, albeit at a slower pace, as interest rates remain favorable and balance sheets strengthen. The private credit market is poised for further growth, offering opportunities for banks, alternative asset managers, and insurance companies, provided it is managed prudently. In diversified industries, credit rating actions were largely confirmations, with some upgrades, such as those for Saputo Inc. and Dollarama Inc. The energy, utilities, and natural resources sectors also saw credit rating confirmations despite economic headwinds and market volatility.

**Impact of Wildfires on Canadian Insurance and Utilities**

The 2025 wildfire season in Canada has been particularly severe, with over 4.7 million hectares burned by July 7, significantly exceeding the 10-year average of 1.6 million hectares. This has led to large-scale evacuations and infrastructure damage, particularly in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and Alberta. The Canadian property and casualty insurance sector, while well-capitalized, faces increased pressure on underwriting models, reinsurance strategies, and pricing assumptions due to the rising frequency and severity of wildfires. Insured losses from weather-related catastrophes, including wildfires, reached a record CAD 8.5 billion in 2024. Utilities are also under strain, as wildfire-related losses and liabilities weaken their credit profiles. Insurance costs for utilities exposed to wildfire risk have risen significantly, and some insurers are retreating from these markets. Utilities are adapting by implementing mitigation efforts, such as stronger infrastructure and smarter operations, to reduce ignitions and financial fallout. Regulators face the challenge of enabling necessary safety investments while maintaining financial viability and reliable service.

**LNG Exports and North American Gas Prices**

The North American gas market is experiencing support from a seasonal peak in air-conditioning demand and expanding LNG exports. After a warm June, temperatures have cooled slightly, but the peak AC demand period remains ahead. U.S. LNG exports continue to grow, with new facilities like Calcasieu Pass and Plaquemines LNG in Louisiana commencing operations. The delivered cost of U.S. gas to Europe, ranging from $8 to $9 per thousand cubic feet, remains competitive against other global suppliers. Additionally, Canada's first LNG shipment to Asia from the LNG Canada export facility in British Columbia marks a strategic move to reduce dependency on the U.S. market. Europe's reduced pipeline supply from Russia has increased its reliance on seaborne LNG, with storage levels moderately lower than historical averages, necessitating more LNG imports in 2025 compared to 2024. This dynamic supports North American gas prices and highlights the growing importance of LNG in global energy markets.
