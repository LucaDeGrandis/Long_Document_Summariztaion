**Credit Rating Trends and Actions**

In July 2025, the credit rating landscape saw a mix of confirmations and changes across various sectors. Sovereign credit ratings were largely confirmed, though Austria was assigned a negative trend, reflecting potential fiscal challenges. Hungary received a new credit rating, indicating a shift in its economic outlook. Financial institutions experienced more positive credit rating actions than negative ones, with notable upgrades in global banks and insurance sectors. This trend suggests a strengthening in the financial sector's resilience despite global tariff uncertainties.

In diversified industries, credit rating actions were predominantly confirmations, with significant upgrades for companies like Saputo Inc. and Dollarama Inc. This indicates a stable credit environment for these industries, even amidst economic uncertainties and Middle East conflicts. The energy, utilities, and natural resources sectors also saw credit rating confirmations, highlighting their ability to navigate economic volatility. Asset finance sectors remained stable, though the One Big Beautiful Bill Act introduced changes to clean energy project tax credits, potentially impacting future investments. The private credit sector faced increased downgrade activity, with a downgrade to upgrade ratio nearing 3x, reflecting challenges in revenue growth and borrowing costs.

**Impact of Wildfires on Canadian Insurance and Utilities**

Canada's 2025 wildfire season is shaping up to be one of the most destructive on record, with over 4.7 million hectares burned by early July. This is significantly above the 10-year average of 1.6 million hectares, with intense fires in provinces like Manitoba, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and Alberta. The Canadian property and casualty (P&C) insurance sector remains well-capitalized, but the rising frequency and severity of wildfires are pressuring underwriting models and reinsurance strategies. Insured losses from weather-related catastrophes reached a record CAD 8.5 billion in 2024, yet the credit outlook for Canadian P&C insurers remains stable due to strong capital buffers and regulatory oversight.

Wildfires also pose a growing risk to utility companies, traditionally seen as stable and low-risk. The increase in wildfire-related losses and liabilities is straining utilities' finances and weakening their credit profiles. Insurance costs for utilities with wildfire exposure have risen significantly, and private insurers are retreating from these markets. Utilities are adapting by implementing mitigation efforts, such as stronger infrastructure and smarter operations, to reduce ignitions and financial fallout. Regulators face the challenge of enabling safety investments while maintaining financial viability and reliable service.

**North American Energy Market Dynamics**

The North American energy market is experiencing dynamic changes, with seasonal peaks in air conditioning demand and expanding liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports supporting spot gas prices. After a warm June, temperatures have cooled slightly, but the peak AC demand period is still ahead. U.S. LNG exports continue to rise, with new facilities in Louisiana and Texas coming online, and Canada's first LNG shipment to Asia marking a significant milestone. This expansion provides Canada with access to Pacific markets, reducing dependency on the U.S. market.

Europe's reduced pipeline supply of Russian gas has increased reliance on seaborne LNG, with storage levels moderately lower than historical averages. This necessitates increased LNG imports in 2025 compared to 2024. The competitive cost of U.S. gas, ranging from $8 to $9 per thousand cubic feet, positions North American suppliers favorably in the global market. These developments highlight the evolving landscape of the energy sector, driven by geopolitical factors and infrastructure expansions.
