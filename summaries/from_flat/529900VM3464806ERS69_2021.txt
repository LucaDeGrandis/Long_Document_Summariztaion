**New Level of Awareness in Climate-Related Developments**

In 2021, the urgency of addressing climate change reached new heights, particularly highlighted by the discussions and outcomes of COP26. This year marked a significant shift in awareness, emphasizing the need for timely action to mitigate climate change. A notable development was the commitment of half of the global asset management industry to the Net Zero Asset Manager initiative, signaling a collective move towards achieving net zero emissions. Additionally, the announcement by the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation to establish a new International Sustainability Standards Board represents a critical step towards providing investors with the necessary financial information to make informed decisions regarding sustainability.

**Challenges in Climate Reporting and Data**

Despite the progress in awareness and commitment, significant challenges remain in climate reporting and data. There is a pressing need for harmonized and internationally compatible standards around taxonomies, disclosures, and benchmarks. Current disclosure requirements are largely inadequate, focusing primarily on climate-related risks without addressing broader sustainability issues such as inequality and human rights violations. This gap highlights the necessity for a more comprehensive approach to sustainability reporting that encompasses all relevant factors impacting the environment and society.

**DWS's Net Zero Strategy and Corporate Actions**

DWS has set ambitious targets to achieve net zero emissions, both in its portfolio and operations, by 2050. As part of this strategy, the company aims to reduce its carbon intensity by 50% by 2030. This commitment involves a thorough analysis of its operational CO2 footprint and a strategic shift in how it conducts business and collaborates with vendors. DWS recognizes that achieving these targets requires not only technological and operational changes but also a cultural transformation within the organization. By aligning its actions with the Science-Based Targets initiative, DWS is laying a robust foundation for its emission reduction goals.

**Governance and Risk Management in Climate Strategy**

The governance structure at DWS plays a pivotal role in managing climate-related risks and opportunities. The Group Sustainability Council is tasked with driving alignment and overseeing climate-related activities across the organization. Climate risks are integrated into DWS's overall risk management framework, with scenario analyses employed to assess the potential impacts on the business. This approach ensures that DWS is well-prepared to navigate the complexities of climate change and its implications for the financial sector.

**Metrics and Targets for Climate Action**

DWS is committed to measuring its progress in climate action through a set of sustainability KPIs. These include tracking ESG assets under management, corporate engagement numbers, and improvements in sustainability ratings. In 2021, DWS achieved a B rating from the CDP, reflecting its efforts to enhance climate-related disclosures. The company is also focused on increasing the proportion of its investments that are aligned with science-based targets, demonstrating its dedication to contributing to a sustainable future. By setting clear metrics and targets, DWS is able to monitor its progress and make informed decisions to advance its climate strategy.
